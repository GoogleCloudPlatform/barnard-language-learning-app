1) Configure GCP_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID in config.sh
2) Run deploy_admin_project.sh to create the GCP admin projects
3) Create an OAuth client ID in the admin project and download the secret
4) In config.sh, configure CLIENT_ID_FILE with the local path to the secret and
  configure also GCP_LANGUAGE_PROJECT_NAME with the unique GCP project ID.
  If this is not unique, the script will generate an error.
  Configure also GCP_ORG_ID and optionally GCP_FOLDER_ID.
  If GCP_FOLDER_ID, the project will be created under that folder.
  If GCP_FOLDER_ID is empty and GCP_ORG_ID is not empty, the project will be
  created under the org node.
  Otherwise it will not be attached to a parent.
5) Run ./create_project.sh to create the GCP language projects or
  ./update_project.sh to update it.

If you want to create another language project, repeat steps 4-5.
